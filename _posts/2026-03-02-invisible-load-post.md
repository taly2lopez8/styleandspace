Good morning.

Today is my first day back in tech.

And I’m writing this from my car.

Not because it’s dramatic.  
Not because it’s aesthetic.  
But because it’s real life.

Three months ago, I was exhausted.

I was working as a field marketer — and if you’ve ever worked “in the field,” you know what that means. Travel. Hotels. Airports. Late dinners. Early flights. Living out of a suitcase. At first, it feels glamorous. New cities. Room service. Weekends in places you’ve never been.

And then… it gets old.

It gets heavy.

It started affecting my sleep. My health. My ability to eat well. My time with Julia. And I reached a point where I had to ask myself:

> Is this sustainable?

I love marketing. I love tech. I love building things.  
But I didn’t love what it was costing me.

So I stepped back.

And that’s when Style & Space began to grow roots.

## Why I Started My “Influencer Era”

Back in November, I joked about entering my “influencer era.”

I started sharing Amazon finds. Outfits. Books. Things that made my life easier.

But it was never about “buy this and your life will be perfect.”

It was about this:

If something works for me, I’ll share it.  
If it works for you, amazing.  
If it doesn’t, ignore it.

We do not need to spend money we don’t have to prove anything to anyone.

Style & Space is not about consumption.  
It’s about intention.

Underneath the outfits and links is something deeper.

## The Pressure Women Carry

Somewhere along the way, society told women:

You can have it all.

Career. Motherhood. Beauty. Independence. Confidence.

And then added:

But you better do it perfectly.

That pressure drives me crazy.

After becoming a mother, everything changed for me.

Julia is watching me.

Not just listening — watching.

And I had to ask myself:

- Do I want her to grow up believing she has to be exhausted to be worthy?
- That she has to do everything alone?
- That support is weakness?

No.

I want her to see that she can build the life she wants — with support. With intention. With systems. With community.

Living in another country, far from my original support system, I know how hard it is not to have that village.

So I decided to create one.

## What Style & Space Really Is

Style & Space is not just outfits.

It’s not just product links.

It’s a virtual village.

A space where women can:

- Build careers without burning out  
- Raise children without losing themselves  
- Care about how they look without shame  
- Learn about money without fear  
- Take care of their mental health without apology  

Financial education is a huge part of this for me.

Women need to understand savings. Investing. Credit. Independence.

Not because we reject partnership.

But because we should never depend on anyone for our security.

That’s something I want for my daughter. For my friends. For myself.

And I’m learning as I go — and bringing you with me.

## Today: My First Day Back

After three months building Style & Space quietly, today I’m starting a new job.

Back in marketing. Back in tech. Back in the office.

And I’m excited.

Because I realized something important:

You can want more than one thing.

You can love your career and build a business.  
You can be ambitious and present.  
You can want stability and creativity.  
You can want money and meaning.

The key isn’t doing everything at once.

It’s focusing on one thing at a time — with support.

## A Question for You

Do you believe you can do everything you want?

What feels impossible right now?

Is it:

- Time?  
- Support?  
- Confidence?  
- Money?  
- Energy?  

What would change if you stopped trying to do it perfectly — and started building it intentionally?

This blog is the beginning.

The car conversations will continue.  
The outfit links will live here.  
The money conversations are coming.  
The systems. The resets. The weekly focus.

Style & Space is growing.

And today, as I drive into my first day back in tech, I’m not choosing one version of myself over the other.

I’m choosing all of them.

One focused step at a time.
